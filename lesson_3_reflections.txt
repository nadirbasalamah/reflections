2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
ans : because we want to check the project result after pull changes so we always pull the repository if the project getting better or have more features rather than always pull automatically even the pull changes cause a bug on a project

branches : create another version in a project in a local machine or in GitHub
